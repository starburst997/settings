Keeping a backup of the settings to various tools installed on my computer that I use (and keeping a list of them).

Eventually, I want this repo to be the starting point whenever I format my PC and re-install everything from scratch that I need during my day-to-day work. Including step-by-step for tricky stuff that I will most likely forget and have to search on [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/) for the Nth time.

On my developer journey I went from Windows to Linux to Mac back to **Windows** again. I prefer Windows just for the fact that I spend far less time configuring everything and most things just work out of the box (loosing a day just to get breakpoints working is not fun). I keep a [Windows Terminal](https://github.com/microsoft/terminal) with [WSL2](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install) open always, so I get the best of both world. I still try from time to time to switch back to linux full-time but I keep coming back. It also depends on the technology, if I was only doing web dev, that would be a different story. Mac is nice and polish but I kept missing some tools, they cost a lot as well but I'm very intrigued with trying out the new [M2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_M2) machines.

I've tried different IDEs / Text Editor ([Eclipse](https://www.eclipse.org/ide/), [FlashDevelop](https://www.flashdevelop.org/), [Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com/), [Vim](https://www.vim.org/), [Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/), [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/), even [Emacs](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/) for a brief while since that's what [Jonathan Blow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonathan_Blow) use, etc.). Nowadays, I'm always coming back to **[Rider](https://www.jetbrains.com/rider/)**, despite it flaws (huge resource hogs, [annoying bugs](https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issue/RIDER-19870), etc.) it is the one that I prefer for the work I'm currently doing. The shortcuts, debugger, ReSharper, VCS, Profiling, etc. everything just click and works very well. Just wished it ran faster.
